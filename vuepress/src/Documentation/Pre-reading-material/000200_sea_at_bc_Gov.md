* The above images shows the relationship between services offered in different scopes of the various contexts of the AWS SEA. BC Gov teams will be working primarily in the green area with some services from the blue. 
* The green services have been tested by the Cloud Pathfinder team for good fit within the guardrails of the environment.  
* Some services are not compatible but in general there is a pattern for teams to use the blue ones if needed.

 * Over time, regardless of the particular brand of the cloud, the number of services in the SEA available to BC Gov teams will go up and we expect the green set of services to mostly overlap the blue.

  * We see here that the training available online and from each Cloud Service Provider like AWS does not take into account the SEAs as these are very cutting-edge environments.  Over time the training will catch up.  For now, we have customized training so that teams do not get confused when the patterns they learned elsewhere do not function in the SEA.  We show them equivalent, safe ways of operating in the SEA.
